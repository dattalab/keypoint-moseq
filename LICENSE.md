# Non-Commercial Research and Academic Use Software License and Terms of Use


Keypoint-MoSeq is a software package that includes original code created by the Harvard researchers listed below (the “Software”), and third-party code that may be obtained by End Users separately. The Software is designed to label behaviors identified from keypoint tracking data through the use of computational modeling and fitting approaches. The Software was developed by Caleb Weinreb, Ph.D. and Sandeep Robert Datta, Ph.D. at Harvard University. It is distributed for free academic and non-commercial research use by the President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”).

Using the Software indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms of this Software Use Agreement (“Agreement”). Absent your agreement to the terms below, you (the “End User”) have no rights to hold or use the Software whatsoever.

Harvard agrees to grant hereunder a limited non-exclusive license to End User for the use of the Software in the performance of End User’s internal, non-commercial research and academic use at End User’s academic or not-for-profit research institution (“Institution”) on the following terms and conditions:
