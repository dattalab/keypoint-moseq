# Keypoint MoSeq 

![logo](docs/source/_static/logo.jpg)

Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) is an unsupervised machine learning method for animal behavior analysis. Given behavioral recordings, MoSeq learns a set of stereotyped movement patterns and when they occur over time. This package provides tools for fitting a MoSeq model to keypoint tracking data [(Weinreb et al., 2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.16.532307v1).
