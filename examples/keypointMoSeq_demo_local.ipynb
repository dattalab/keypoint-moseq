    "4. **Apply the model:** The learned model parameters are used to infer a syllable sequence for each experiment. This step should always be applied at the end of model fitting, and it can also be used later on to infer syllable sequences for newly added data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, the main hyperparam that needs to be adjusted is **kappa**, which sets the time-scale of syllables. Higher kappa leads to longer syllables. For this tutorial we chose kappa values that yielded a median syllable duration of 400ms (12 frames). In general, you will need to tune kappa for each new dataset based on the intended syllable time-scale. **You will need to pick two kappas: one for AR-HMM fitting and one for keypoint-SLDS.**\n",
